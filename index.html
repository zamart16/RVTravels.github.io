                   <p> I  went on a trip to Biao, Digos City to accompany someone to pass her thesis draft to her teacher. It was a short but pleasant 10-15 minutes ride from Tiguman, Digos City to Biao on a tricycle.I was pleasantly surprised to discover that the teacher’s house was situated near the beach. It was not something I had expected, but it turned out to be a delightful surprise. Upon arriving at the teacher’s house near the beach, we spent 2 hours relaxing, feeling the gentle breeze, and breathing in the fresh air of the beach. Every second spent there was pure happiness. We immersed ourselves in the surroundings, laughing, talking, and simply enjoying each other’s company. Spending those 2 hours at the beach was truly a fun and happy experience. 

                        Although our purpose for visiting Biao was primarily academic, the tranquil beach experience became an unexpected bonus. This trip taught me the importance of finding joy in unexpected places, of embracing the surprises that life throws our way. It reminded me that sometimes the most magical moments are the ones we stumble upon, rather than meticulously plan.</p>

                   <p>It was an exciting day as my father and I embarked on a journey to Davao City from our hometown, Digos City. Our goal was to buy a brand new laptop for my studies. 

                    Early in the morning, we prepared ourselves and made sure that we had everything we needed for the day. Dad had his motorcycle ready, all fueled up and in top condition. We hopped on, excitedly wearing our helmets, and began our one-hour and thirty-minute journey.
                    
                    The ride was surprisingly smooth, with the cool wind rushing against our faces. As we ventured towards Davao City, I couldn't help but appreciate the scenic view that surrounded us. The lush green fields and beautiful mountains in the distance created a picturesque backdrop for our adventure.
                    
                    Once we arrived at Davao City, our first stop was  Ecoland Coastal road. We couldn't resist the urge to take a picture to commemorate our trip. It was a moment of pure joy and happiness with my father.
                    
                    After capturing this beautiful memory, we continued our journey to find the perfect laptop. Dad had done his research and knew exactly which store to go to. The excitement of buying a new laptop for school filled me with anticipation.
                    
                    Upon arrival at the store, we were greeted by friendly staff who guided us through the selection of laptops. Dad carefully examined each model, ensuring it met all the specifications required for my academic needs. It was impressive to see his dedication and effort in finding the perfect laptop for me. <br> <br>
                    
                    Finally, after thorough consideration, we chose the ideal laptop that would accompany me through my educational journey. It was an immense sense of gratitude and joy, knowing that my father had gone above and beyond to provide me with the tools necessary for my studies.
                    
                    As we drove back home, the laptop secured safely in a bag, a feeling of contentment washed over me. Not only did I have a brand new laptop, but I also had cherished memories of this trip with my father. The effort he put into this journey made me appreciate his love and dedication even more.    </p>
